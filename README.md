**Inspiration**
After reading Accenture's explanation of the struggle of recruiting public servants, we felt inspired to develop a project to help with this. We thought that it would be helpful to match applicant with government jobs based on their passions, so we created FedMatch

**What it does**
FedMatch is a website that matches potential employees with government agencies. All users need to is input their areas of interest and the website displays suitable job listings. We want to make job searching efficient and quick so that younger people can find their dream jobs in government agencies.

**How we built it**
We used front-end tools like HTML, CSS and Javascript to design our webpage. We also used basic UI/UX elements to make sure that our website looked modern. We used bright colors and snazzy features to attract a younger audience.

**Challenges we ran into**
We had some trouble with resizing the logo image in the navigation bar. We also had minor issues with our Javascript code where the results were not displaying correctly. However, we managed to figure it out.

**Accomplishments that we're proud of**
We are very proud of being able to create a professional looking website in the time provided. In addition, we were able to essentially create a search function using JavaScript, which is a big accomplishment.

**What we learned**
We learned front-end development. As beginners in coding, this was a very insightful experience. We were able to learn the intricacies of a website's aesthetic elements. We also learned how to use keywords to match results using Javascript.

**What's next for FedMatch****
We plan to expand our database using APIs from different job listing websites like LinkedIn and Indeed. We can use this data to make our search wider and connect users to their desired jobs. We also would like to have a newsletter where users will be emailed jobs related to their areas of interest.
